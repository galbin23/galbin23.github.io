# Grant Albin - Personal Portfolio

A simple, semantic HTML portfolio website built for a web development assignment.

## Description
This is my personal portfolio page showcasing a clean HTML structure, proper heading hierarchy, internal navigation, a validated contact form, and basic CSS styling. It demonstrates semantic markup, accessibility basics, and form validation.

## Features
- Semantic HTML5 structure (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `article`, `footer`)
- Correct heading order (h1 → h2 → h3)
- Navigation with internal jump links (#about, #skills, #projects, #contact)
- About section with 2+ paragraphs
- Unordered list of 6+ skills
- Projects section with 2+ `<article>` elements
- Contact form with required fields, proper labels, text/email inputs, textarea, and minlength validation
- Clean, readable CSS styling (mobile-friendly layout, colors, hover effects)
- External link to GitHub in the footer
